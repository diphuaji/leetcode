# A: heap
# we have to capsulate keys and vals into objects
# also HEAP-related functions have to deal with these objects accordingly

####FIFO queue####
# use a min-heap
# with each obj enqueued, 1 is added to its key
ENQUEUE(obj):
    HEAP-INSERT(A,obj)
# with each obj popped, the corredsponding obj gets extracted

#####stack####
# use a max-heap
# with each obj pushed in, 1 is added to its key
PUSH(obj):
    HEAP-INSERT(A,obj)
# with each obj popped, the corredsponding obj gets extracted
